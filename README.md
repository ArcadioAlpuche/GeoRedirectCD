# GeoRedirectCD

## General info
This project is a custom WordPress plugin that was created for Contour Design's website. The purpose of this plugin was to redirect European customers from the US web page to the same page of the country code they reside in. It was originally created by another developer, but I troubleshooted and made necessary changes for it to work properly on our website.

## What I Learned
This is my first WordPress plguin that I have been involved in creating and implementing. I learned about the different requirements for creating a WordPress plugin. This is the first time I have had to find a user's country code to make a decision. I also had to troubleshoot the plugin using console.log() to see how far the code was getting and where the issues were happening.
